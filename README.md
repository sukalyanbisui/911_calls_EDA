# 911 Calls Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python 
<br>
I'm sharing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization of the data from Spotify using Python - A Data Analysis Project performed in my journey into Data Science.

## About the Project

Conducted comprehensive data analysis of Emergency (911) Calls dataset, generating insightful visualizations including
count plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and cluster maps. Gained valuable insights into Fire, Traffic, and EMS call patterns.<br>

- Here, l have explored and quantified data about given and drawn valuable insights.
- Conducted data cleaning to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the 911 Calls dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn).
- Use data to identify patterns and relationships between different characteristics. The activity will support in developing ability to review and interpret a dataset.
